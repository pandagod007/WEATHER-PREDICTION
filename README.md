# Random Forest Weather Prediction System

## Overview

This repository contains a Random Forest-based weather prediction system. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to predict weather conditions based on historical data. Random Forest algorithm is employed due to its effectiveness in handling large datasets with numerous features while minimizing overfitting.

## Features

- Utilizes historical weather data for training and testing.
- Implements Random Forest algorithm for weather prediction.
- Provides accurate weather forecasts based on input parameters.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the prediction system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/random-forest-weather-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd random-forest-weather-prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your historical weather data in a CSV format. Ensure that the dataset contains relevant features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
2. Run the `train.py` script to train the Random Forest model on your historical data:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/data.csv --model_path /path/to/save/model.pkl
```

3. Once the model is trained, you can use the `predict.py` script to make weather predictions:

```bash
python predict.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model.pkl --input_data /path/to/input/data.csv
```

4. The predicted weather conditions will be displayed, providing valuable insights into future weather patterns.

## Example

Suppose you have a dataset `weather_data.csv` containing historical weather data. To train the model and make predictions:

```bash
python train.py --data_path weather_data.csv --model_path trained_model.pkl

python predict.py --model_path trained_model.pkl --input_data new_data.csv
```
